This is not a random webpage.

It’s a small pause in the internet  
made only for you.

## Hi Nooru.

We went from talking every day  
to not talking at all.

And that feels strange.

## I don’t want to restart everything.

I don’t want to go backwards.

I just want…

one normal conversation ☕

Like two people who once meant a lot to each other.

## Let go of your hollow ego

I know a tiny part of you  
misses the normal version of us too…

### let’s talk.
